## Design

The nature and ethos of the website is relaxed, casual boardgame reviews and so the pallette is dark, and subtle. Dark mode on devices can reduce blue light exposure and can, in some cases, [reduce eye strain](https://www.eyecarecenter.com/eye-care-resources/is-dark-mode-better-for-your-eyes) so it was the natural choice for a more relaxed website.
